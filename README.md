### GLOBAL
Wiped all beta/testing versions and creating a new Tag called `v0.0.1T`, that's based on the `Branch T` I will work on there for testing purposes and the `Branch M` will be used for releases.

*Ideas*
* Create `Branch T` for testing purposes;
* Rename `Main` Branch to `Branch M` which will be used for Releases;
* Create `Branch P` for Pull-Requests / community edits (most likely for ideas to edit code and etc and then I'll test and if it works I'll move the code into the `Branch T` to edit it and add better performance into it;

### T Branch
